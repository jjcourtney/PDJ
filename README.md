# INFOCRAFT

Infocraft is not an application, it’s an idea, a culture, a collective vision, shared by three diligent engineers looking to nurture the community and competitive aspects of the massive gaming behemoth that is Minecraft. 

Info-craft brings users together to compare stats and achievements with one another, pushing players to compete to being the best crafter there ever was.

* New Technologies


## Successes:

* We created a methodical approach to solving problems step by step

## Application Requirements

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Overall

We have made a really good app in such a short time considering it was our first time working together. It has a lot of scalibility and as such a popular game im sure many people will find it useful.
